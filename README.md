# FEC-Project (Catwalk)
A fully functional front end application that is integrated with an already existing API. <br />

This project was a foray into real development where our team was challenged with new technical and project management challenges. The function and design of this application was constructed in a manner to meet the specifications and requirements outlined by mock project stakeholders.
